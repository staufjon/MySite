								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I'm a Product Manager and AI Delivery Specialist with a passion for leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve real-world business problems. Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Information Systems at the University of Utah's Eccles School of Business, I bring hands-on experience in AI product development, cross-functional team leadership, and technical implementation.</p>
								<p>My work spans multiple AI-powered products, from equipment rental tools to creative brief systems and chatbot platforms. I've worked with over 75 AI models from leading providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Groq, always focusing on optimizing performance and delivering value to users.</p>
								<p>With a background in both product management and web development, I bridge the gap between technical capabilities and business needs. Whether it's implementing Scrum methodologies, conducting customer interviews, or developing go-to-market strategies, I'm driven by the opportunity to create products that make a real impact.</p>
